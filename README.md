# Turtle-Games
Turtle Games has commissioned KW Data Analytics to conduct an analysis of customer trends in order to improve overall sales performance. 
The marketing department wants to understand how to assess customers by loyalty, how to group customers for targeted campaigns, and how to best use online reviews for marketing and customer engagement. 
The sales department wants to understand the impact of products on sales and how regional sales can predict Global sales. This will help optimize resource allocation and improve the effectiveness of sales tactics.
